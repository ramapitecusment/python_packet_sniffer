Sniffing or network packet sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing all the packets 
passing through a given network using sniffing tools. It is a form wherein, we can “tap phone wires” 
and get to know the conversation. It is also called wiretapping and can be applied to the computer networks.

**Note:** In order to be a man-in-the-middle, you need to execute the ARP spoof script.
